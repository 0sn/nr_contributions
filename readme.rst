contributions
=============

So someone comes and has an idea for a comic, so they give me a suggestion. Or someone draws a guest comic. This is how they are credited.

Some people have more than one contribution, so they become a Contributor.

There's a nasty-ass fat view for the list of contributions. Not sure what to do about that.

Contains an admin view for a nice list of suggestions that haven't been accepted yet.
